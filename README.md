# Anagram Analyzer
## written by Alexander Sergejev

### Description:
* This application takes two words as arguments, and checks whether they are anagrams - words that have the same letters repeated the same number of times in different order. The program ignores capitalization and punctuation. Anagrams can be more than one word long. They can not be the same word. If two words don't share any common letters, they are identified as antigrams.

* For example: "Eat" and "Tea" are anagrams. "Fast Car" and "fat scar" are anagrams. "Gods" and "God's" are the same word. "Ruby" and "Gem" are antigrams.

#### Program can be setup by cloning the project and running '$ bundle' from the root level of the project in a ruby enabled environment.
